# clustered-permutation-test
This is a SAS macro to perform a clustered permutation test
The Simdata_bin.sas simulates a binary dataset as an example dataset
The permuation_macro.sas is a macro to perform a clustered permuation test
By clustered data, I mean when the randomization unit is the cluster such as patients clustered with in physicians, or students within classrooms, etc.
